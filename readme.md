# Temperature converter 
- This project is a basic Celsius to Fahrenheit temperature converter.
- I'm focusing on JavaScript syntax, as I've just learned how to write and use functions.
- This is a work in progress, I will continue to add and implement code.

## The JavaScript logic
- The first step I'm going through is console.log() the convertion from  Celsius to Fahrenheit, with a really simple formula from a given value.

## What I've learnt
- Convert the string value of the 'Temperature' input to a number using the parseInt() function. This allows me to perform calculations with it and calculate the numeric value in Fahrenheit.


``` js snippet

var celsiusNum= parseInt(celsiusValue);

```
